F5 Distributed Cloud SMSv2 CE on Azure with API Protection
#########################################################
Scope
-------
APIs power apps, but without proper attention, they can expose organizations to significant risks. APIs are a fundamental building block of modern application development, powering apps that impact lives. As modern applications have evolved, dependencies on APIs have increased. That’s because by enabling disparate systems to work collectively, APIs can speed up time-to-market for application development and deliver improved user experiences. API endpoints increase an application’s attack surface area and introduce new risks and vulnerabilities that traditional app security tools struggle to mitigate.

F5 Distributed Cloud API Security is a comprehensive solution to securely manage APIs across any data center or cloud using a simple, fast, and scalable architecture. It helps drive business velocity by enabling automated API deployments and management, while also protecting against API-specific threats.

Introduction
--------------
F5 Distributed Cloud Web App and API Protection (WAAP) offers a comprehensive security solution, including WAF, DDoS prevention, API security, and bot mitigation, to protect modern applications. This solution integrates seamlessly with the data plane workflow, and in this example, showcases API security implementation within a customer's existing Azure infrastructure using F5 Distributed Cloud services.

Distributed Cloud API Security, a key part of WAAP, provides robust API protection through discovery, monitoring, and enforcement. It enables organizations to identify unknown APIs, continuously monitor and secure them, and enforce schema compliance. The service offers insight into the full API ecosystem, mapping endpoints, communication paths, and shadow or outdated APIs for complete visibility.

This demo guide provides step-by-step walkthrough for enabling API Protection on Secure Mesh Site v2 (SMSv2) Customer Edge (CE) site manually using F5 Distributed Cloud (XC) console.

8. Scroll down to API Protection and select “Enable” in API Definition field and click “Add Item”

.. image:: ./assets/azure-api/14-api-protection-enable.png

9. Enter a name and click “Upload OpenAPI file”

.. image:: ./assets/azure-api/15-upload-openapi-file.png

10. Enter a name and upload the open API/ swagger file for your application (for this demonstration crAPI is used where “minimum” quantity is configured in OpenAPI file which was missing in original file causing the API issue)

    - GitHub link - https://github.com/OWASP/crAPI/blob/develop/openapi-spec/crapi-openapi-spec.json

.. image:: ./assets/azure-api/16-openapi-file-configuration.jpeg

11. Click “Add OpenAPI File”

.. image:: ./assets/azure-api/17-openapi-file.png

12. Success message will be displayed after adding and the file will be available in the dropdown

.. image:: ./assets/azure-api/18-openapi-file-success.png

13. Select the file from the dropdown and click “Add API Definition”

.. image:: ./assets/azure-api/19-select-openapi-file.png

14. Now from your LB main config page, select “Custom List” for “Validation” field and click Configure

.. image:: ./assets/azure-api/20-api-validation.png

15. Click “Configure” under Validation List

.. image:: ./assets/azure-api/21-validation-list-configure.png

16. Start configuring Validation List, click “Add Item”

.. image:: ./assets/azure-api/22-validation-list-add-item.png

17. Enter a name, select “Validate” for “OpenAPI Validation Request Processing Mode” field, select “Block” for field “Request Validation Enforcement Type” and select all available properties in “Request Validation Properties” field, below of the config page select “Base Path - /” for “Type” field and click “Apply”

.. image:: ./assets/azure-api/23-validation-configurations.png

18. Click “Apply” in “Validation List” and “Validation Rules” page as well

.. image:: ./assets/azure-api/24-validation-configured.png

19. “API Discovery” is also enabled for this demonstration to showcase the Distributed Cloud’s ability to perform automation discovery of APIs exposed by the application and to generate swagger definition

.. image:: ./assets/azure-api/25-api-discovery.png

20. Click “Add HTTP Load Balancer” and wait for around ~5 minutes for LB to provision and come up completely.

.. image:: ./assets/azure/smsv2-azure-lb8.png

21. Access the LB URL and crAPI application should be available which is deployed in Ubuntu VM using docker and exposed through port 8888

.. image:: ./assets/azure-api/25-crapi-login.png

22. Create an account using “SignUp” and login using that account and navigate to “Shop” tab

.. image:: ./assets/azure-api/26-crapi-shop.png

.. image:: ./assets/azure-api/27-crapi-shop-balance.png

23. Buy an item and observe the balance getting decreased, which is expected scenario

.. image:: ./assets/azure-api/28-crapi-order-success.png

.. image:: ./assets/azure-api/29-crapi-order-success-payload.png

.. image:: ./assets/azure-api/30-crapi-order-success-response.png

24. Now using the request details (URL, Method and Payload) craft a request with a negative quantity, observe the request is getting blocked by F5 Distributed Cloud, based on our minimum quantity configuration in OpenAPI file

.. image:: ./assets/azure-api/31-crapi-pm-block.png

.. image:: ./assets/azure-api/32-crapi-pm-block-log.png

25. If “API Protection” was not enabled and sending the request with negative quantity would trigger the credit to increase, which is a critical bug

.. image:: ./assets/azure-api/33-crapi-pm-allow.png

26. “API Discovery” enabled in Step 19 will take some time based on application traffic and number of APIs, once the discovery process is done, below is the sample API graph output

.. image:: ./assets/azure-api/34-crapi-api-discovery.png


Conclusion
--------------
This guide demonstrated how to enable API Security on an SMSv2 CE site using the F5 Distributed Cloud console. You deployed the CE in Azure, set up a test Ubuntu VM, deployed an application in the VM, and configured origin pools and load balancers. API Protection was successfully applied and verified with tampered requests. Additionally, you enabled “API Discovery” to automatically detect and classify APIs in your environment, and verified its functionality. This setup also enhances protection against API-specific threats such as malicious payloads, unauthorized access, and abusive behavior, while integrating seamlessly with additional security features, when enabled, like WAF, Bot Defense, and DDoS protection, ensuring comprehensive and robust application security.
