Deploying F5 Distributed Cloud Customer Edge Site on a Bare Metal Hardware in Private Cloud Network
==========================================================================

Introduction
***************
F5 Distributed Cloud (F5 XC) supports deploying its services as a node on bare metal hardware. This capability allows services and applications running on bare metal to connect seamlessly to the F5 XC Global Network, ensuring consistent delivery, security, and performance across diverse distributed infrastructure.

By installing the F5 XC ISO image on bare metal hardware, you can configure it as a Customer Edge (CE) site. This setup helps redirect traffic from the Regional Edge (RE) to the applications deployed behind the CE, providing enhanced security and optimized traffic management. This approach ensures that applications benefit from the robust security features and performance enhancements offered by the F5 XC platform.

        - Click on Save and Exit to create vK8s object.

        - Select ``…`` > ``kubeconfig`` for the vK8s object to download the Kubeconfig file.

        .. figure:: Assets/download_kubeconfig_file.jpg

        - Deploy the application on bare metal CE using the kubeconfig file for the vK8s object created above.

        .. figure:: Assets/app_deploy.jpg

Step 5: Creating Origin Pool and Load Balancer
        **Step 5.1: Creating Origin Pool**

        - Creating an origin pool for application deployed in private cloud on the CE site.

        .. figure:: Assets/origin_pool.jpg

        - Created a Load Balancer and assigned Origin Pool to the Load Balancer to access the application.

        .. figure:: Assets/load_balancer.jpg

        - Application is accessible.

        .. figure:: Assets/app_accessibility.jpg

         Created a WAF policy with Enforcement mode as blocking and assigned it to the Load Balancer.

        .. figure:: Assets/waf_firewall.jpg

        When a client requests forceful browsing of exe file, which is a file type violation, it triggers the security event, and the request gets blocked by XC WAF.
