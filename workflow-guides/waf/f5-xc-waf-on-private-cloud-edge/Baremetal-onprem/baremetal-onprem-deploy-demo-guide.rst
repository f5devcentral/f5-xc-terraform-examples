Deploying F5 Distributed Cloud Customer Edge Site on a Bare Metal Hardware in Private Cloud Network
==========================================================================

Introduction
***************
F5 Distributed Cloud (F5 XC) supports deploying its services as a node on bare metal hardware. This capability allows services and applications running on bare metal to connect seamlessly to the F5 XC Global Network, ensuring consistent delivery, security, and performance across diverse distributed infrastructure.

By installing the F5 XC ISO image on bare metal hardware, you can configure it as a Customer Edge (CE) site. This setup helps redirect traffic from the Regional Edge (RE) to the applications deployed behind the CE, providing enhanced security and optimized traffic management. This approach ensures that applications benefit from the robust security features and performance enhancements offered by the F5 XC platform.
