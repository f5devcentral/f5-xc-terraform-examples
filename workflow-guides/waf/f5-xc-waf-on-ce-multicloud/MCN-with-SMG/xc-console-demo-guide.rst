Manual step by step process for the deployment
===============================================
This document covers details on overview, deploying and testing of Multi Cloud Networking using Site Mesh Group use case. In this use case we have deployed a demo application across GCP and Azure clouds. Application front-end product page is deployed in GCP and another service which fetches book details is deployed in Azure.

        .. figure:: assets/details-advertise-configs.JPG
        
        .. figure:: assets/waf-configs.JPG

**Note: Since the details LB is advertised to GCP CE site on inside network, details page cannot be accessible directly from outside(internet). Additionally, attached WAF policies on both frontend and backend loadbalancers will help provide robust security to the application environment**

7. Create labels and Site Mesh Group
      i. From the F5 XC Console homepage, select "Shared Configurations".
      ii. Select "Manage > Labels", select "Label Keys" and click on "Add Known Key".

      vi. Next navigate to "Manage > Networking", select "Site Mesh Groups" and click on "Add Site Mesh Group"
      vii. Create a Site Mesh Group using Full Mesh topology and above created Virtual Server as shown below
    
      .. figure:: assets/smg.JPG

      viii. Navigate to "Overview" --> "Networking" and then to "Topology" and click on your SMG name. Once opened validate mesh network is up between these two sites

      .. figure:: assets/smg-network.JPG

      ix. Check `doc <https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/how-to/advanced-networking/site-mesh-group for more details>`_ for more details on Site Mesh Groups    


Testing: 
*********

1. Since we didn't configure auto-manage DNS records option during LB creation, in your local machine open hosts file and add GCP CE site IP (you can find this in F5 XC --> GCP site configuration details dialog below section) to your HTTP productpage LB domain name

.. figure:: assets/gcp-site-ip.JPG

.. figure:: assets/hosts.JPG

2. Open a browser and enter the public HTTP load balancer domain name in the URL field

3. Send a GET request and validate UI content is displayed

.. figure:: assets/mcn-productpage.JPG

4. Now update the URL field of postman to `http://<lb-domain-name>/productpage?u=normal`

5. Send the GET request and validate product details are getting displayed as below

.. figure:: assets/mcn-productpage2.JPG

6. Now, let's try a dummy cross-site-scripting attack as shown below

.. figure:: assets/mcn-xss-blocked.JPG

7. Monitor the security event logs from XC console
