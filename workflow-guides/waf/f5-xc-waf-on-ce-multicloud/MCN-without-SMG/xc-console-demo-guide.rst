Traffic Flow
*************
- ProductPage and details Load Balancers (LBs) are advertised to AWS CE Site on outside and inside network respectively.
- Added a DNS entry locally in host file of client's machine to resolve frontend domain name to AWS CE site's public IP.

1. User/Client will initiate a request to product page (frontend) LB domain.
2. DNS resolution will happen and the request will enter to the AWS CE site using ingress interface and then will be redirected to productpage LB.
3. The LB has an origin pool attached to route client request to productpage microservice via AWS CE site.
4. The request will be sent to the AWS CE site.
5. The AWS CE site will then send the request to the origin server hosting productpage microservice.
6. As the origin server is the worker node of the EKS cluster, Productpage pod will then internally call the details(backend) microservice and the request will be sent to the egress interface gateway of the AWS CE site.
7. Since details LB is advertised to inside network of the AWS CE site, request can be redirected to details LB.
8. Details LB again has an origin pool configured to route traffic to the details microservice hosted in Azure cloud platform.
9. Now, the request will be sent to Azure Vnet site via F5 Distributed cloud global (private backbone) network.
10. Request will reach to the Azure Vnet site.
11. Eventually, the request will be sent to the origin server hosting details microservice, completing the entire traffic flow.

- Access to F5 XC account.
- `AWS <https://community.f5.com/kb/technicalarticles/creating-a-credential-in-f5-distributed-cloud-to-use-with-aws/298111>`_ & `Azure <https://community.f5.com/t5/technical-articles/creating-a-credential-in-f5-distributed-cloud-for-azure/ta-p/298316>`_  credentials.

Deployment Steps
*****************

    iv. Navigate to Subnets, Click create subnet.
    v. Select above created VPC, enter a subnet name, IPv4 Subnet CIDR block, click create.  
          - Here we are creating 4 subnets, 2 for site local outside/inside interfaces of AWS VPC Site and 2 for workloads (As EKS cluster requires 2 subnets in different Availability Zones (AZs) to be present inside the VPC).

2. Create an AWS VPC site.
    i. Login to F5 XC Console.
    ii. Select Manage > Site Management > AWS VPC Sites in the configuration menu. Click on Add AWS VPC Site. 
    iii. Enter a name for your VPC site.
    iv. Configure “Site Type Selection” section:
          a. Select AWS cloud credential XC object, if not created click on ‘add item’ button from dropdown menu and create one referring to this `DevCentral article <https://community.f5.com/kb/technicalarticles/creating-a-credential-in-f5-distributed-cloud-to-use-with-aws/298111>`_
          b. Select a region from the AWS Region drop-down field.
          c. Select Existing VPC ID option for VPC field and copy/paste the VPC ID of VPC created in step 1.
          d. Select Ingress/Egress Gateway (Two Interface) option for the Select Ingress Gateway or Ingress/Egress Gateway field. 
          e. Click configure, add AZ and subnet IDs for workload, inside and outside subnets. Apply the configuration.

.. figure:: assets/Capture_n13.JPG

**Note: Since the details LB is advertised to AWS CE site on inside network, details page cannot be accessible directly from outside(internet). Additionally, attached WAF policies on both frontend and backend loadbalancers will help provide robust security to the application environment**

Testing: 
*********

1. For testing purpose edit your local machine's hosts file by adding a line for IP(AWS CE site public IP) to domain(productpage LB domain) mapping or if you have a registered domain name, set up DNS record.

2. Open a browser, enter product page (frontend) domain name in the URL bar and send the request.

.. figure:: assets/Capture_n15.JPG

3. Once request is successful monitor the request logs in the XC console.

.. figure:: assets/Capture_n16.JPG
 
4. Click on "Normal user" hyperlink, it will internally initiate a request from frontend to backend. This step covers end to end traffic flow from frontend to backend.

.. figure:: assets/Capture_n_17.JPG

.. figure:: assets/Capture_n17.JPG

5. Now, monitor the request logs of product page and details LB from the XC Console. 

.. figure:: assets/Capture_n18.JPG

6. Let's try a dummy cross-site-scripting attack.
