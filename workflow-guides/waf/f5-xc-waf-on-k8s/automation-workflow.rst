   +========================+==============+======================================================+
   | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID      | Environment  | Your AWS Access Key ID                               |
   +------------------------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
   | AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY  | Environment  | Your AWS Secret Access Key                           |
   +------------------------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
   | AWS_SESSION_TOKEN      | Environment  | Your AWS Session Token                               | 
   +------------------------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
   | VOLT_API_P12_FILE      | Environment  | Your F5XC API certificate. Set this to **api.p12**   |
   +------------------------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
   | VES_P12_PASSWORD       | Environment  | Set this to the password you supplied                |
   +------------------------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
   | ssh_key                | TERRAFORM    | Your ssh key for accessing the created resources     | 
   +------------------------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
   | tf_cloud_organization  | TERRAFORM    | Your Terraform Cloud Organization name               |
   +------------------------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+

GitHub
-------

-  Fork and Clone Repo. Navigate to ``Actions`` tab and enable it.

-  **Actions Secrets:** Create the following GitHub Actions secrets in
   your forked repo

   -  P12: The linux base64 encoded F5XC P12 certificate
   -  TF_API_TOKEN: Your Terraform Cloud API token
   -  TF_CLOUD_ORGANIZATION: Your Terraform Cloud Organization name
   -  TF_CE_LATITUDE: Your CE location latitude
   -  TF_CE_LONGITUDE: Your CE location longitude
   -  TF_CE_TOKEN: CE token ID generated in Distributed Cloud
   -  TF_VAR_SITE_NAME: CE site name to be registered
   -  TF_CLOUD_WORKSPACE\_\ *<Workspace Name>*: Create for each
      workspace in your workflow per each job

      -  EX: TF_CLOUD_WORKSPACE_EKS would be created with the
         value ``EKS``

-  Check below image for more info on action secrets

Workflow Runs
--------------

**STEP 1:** Check out a branch with the branch name as suggested below for the workflow you wish to run using
the following naming convention.

**DEPLOY**

================ =======================
Workflow         Branch Name
================ =======================
f5-xc-waf-on-k8s deploy-waf-k8s
================ =======================

**DESTROY**

================ ========================
Workflow         Branch Name
================ ========================
f5-xc-waf-on-k8s destroy-waf-k8s
================ ========================

**STEP 2:** Rename ``infra/terraform.tfvars.examples`` to ``infra/terraform.tfvars`` and add the following data: 

-  project_prefix = “Your project identifier name in **lower case** letters only - this will be applied as a prefix to all assets”

-  resource_owner = “Your-name” 

-  aws_region = “AWS Region” ex. us-east-1 

-  azs = [“us-east-1a”, “us-east1b”] - Change to Correct Availability Zones based on selected Region 

-  Also update assets boolean value as per your work-flow

**Step 3:** Rename ``xc/terraform.tfvars.examples`` to ``xc/terraform.tfvars`` and add the following data: 

-  api_url = “Your F5XC tenant” 

-  xc_tenant = “Your tenant id available in F5 XC ``Administration`` section ``Tenant Overview`` menu” 

-  xc_namespace = “The existing XC namespace where you want to deploy resources” 

-  app_domain = “the FQDN of your app (cert will be autogenerated)” 

-  xc_waf_blocking = “Set to true to enable blocking”

-  k8s_pool = "true if backend is residing in k8s"

-  serviceName = "k8s service name of backend"

-  serviceport = "k8s service port of backend"

-  advertise_sites = "set to false if want to advertise on public"

-  http_only = "set to true if want to advertise on http protocol"

**STEP 4:** Commit and push your build branch to your forked repo, Build will run and can be monitored in the GitHub Actions tab and TF Cloud console

**STEP 5:** Once the pipeline completes, verify your CE, Origin Pool and LB were deployed or destroyed based on your workflow.

**STEP 6:** Open a linux shell or CMD, login to AWS console with your credentials, download the kubectl file for this load balancer and check services. Copy the load balancer DNS with name "lb-ver" and send request with XC LB FQDN as a Host header which should provide the application response as shown below

.. image:: /workflow-guides/waf/f5-xc-waf-on-k8s/assets/lb.jpg

.. image:: /workflow-guides/waf/f5-xc-waf-on-k8s/assets/postman.JPG


**STEP 7:** If you want to destroy the entire setup, checkout/create a new branch from ``deploy-waf-k8s`` branch with name ``destroy-waf-k8s`` which will trigger destroy work-flow to remove all resources
