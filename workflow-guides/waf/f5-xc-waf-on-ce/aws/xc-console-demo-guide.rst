2.     Creating an Amazon EKS Cluster along with Node Group:
        **Step 2.1**: Creating a subnet
               a. Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/ and click on Subnets in the navigation pane.
               b. Click on Create Subnet. 
               c. Select the VPC ID that created during deploying of AWS VPC site object mentioned in step 1. Name of the VPC is identified by "ves-vpc" followed by name of the CE site created from F5 XC console. (Ex. ves-vpc-waap-on-ce-aws)
               d. Provide the subnet name, Availability Zone and for IPv4 CIDR block enter the IPv4 CIDR subnet. This IPv4 CIDR should be within VPC network.
               e. Click on Create Subnet.
        **Step 2.2**: Enable auto-assign public IPv4 for subnets
               a. As a prerequisite, we need to enable the auto-assign public IPv4 for subnets associated to VPC.
               b.  Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/ and click on Subnets in the navigation pane.
               c. Identify and select the subnet that is associated to VPC (Ex. ves-vpc-waap-on-ce-aws) and click on Edit subnet setting from the Actions drop-down.
               d. From the Auto-assign IP setting section, enable auto-assign public IPv4 address check box. Click on Save.
               e. Repeat the above step for the subnet created in step 2.1 as well.
        **Step 2.3**: Creating using AWS Management Console
               a. Access Amazon EKS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home#/clusters and navigate to the region in which AWS VPC site is created from F5 XC console.
               b. Click on Create from the Add Cluster drop-down.
               c. On the Configure Cluster page, provide the mandatory details such as Name, Kubernetes version and Cluster service role. Click on Next.
               d. From the Specify networking page, Select the VPC that is already created in AWS region. This is created while deploying the AWS VPC site object mentioned in step 1.
               e. Two subnets related to above VPC will be automatically selected. Selec the security group from the Security groups drop-down. Select ``Public`` Cluster end point access. Click on Next.
               f. Select the log types that you want to enable from the Configure logging page. Click on Next.
               g. From the Select add-ons page, choose the add-ons that you want to add to your cluster. Click on Next.

               i. From the Review and Create page, review the details that we entered and click on Create. There by EKS Cluster will be created and wait for the cluster status to show as ACTIVE.
        **Step 2.4**: Creating a managed node group
               a. Navigate to the name of the EKS cluster that we want to create a managed node group.
               b. Select the Compute tab and click on Add node group.
               c. On the Configure node group page, fill the information as mentioned and click on Next.
               d. From the Set compute and scaling configure page, provide Node group compute & scaling configuration as per requirement, and then click on Next.
               e. On the Specify networking, Subnets will be auto selected as per the VPC. Click on Next.
               f. On the Review and Create page, review the managed node group configurations and click on create. Wait till the status of the node shows Ready.
3.     Deploying the App to EKS Node Group
        **Step 3.1**: Deploy online boutique demo application using the `Manifest File <https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-xc-terraform-examples/blob/main/azure/aks-cluster/manifest.yaml>`__
               The kubectl command-line tool uses kubeconfig files to find the information it needed to choose a cluster and communicate with the API server of the cluster created in step 2.3. kubeconfig file for our Amazon EKS cluster is automatically created with the AWS CLI ``update-kubeconfig`` command. Applicaiton is deployed to the node once the communication is established to the cluster. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-kubeconfig.html
               Below are the steps mentioned to deploy the online boutique application to Amazon EC2 nodes of the cluster,
               
               a. Creating and updating a kubeconfig file and along with example output
                aws eks update-kubeconfig --region region-code --name my-cluster
               An example output is displayed below,

                .. figure:: Assets/create-update-kubeconfig.jpg
               b. Execute ``kubectl apply -f <app_manifest.yaml>`` to deploy the application and ``kubectl get pods`` to verify the pod status.
