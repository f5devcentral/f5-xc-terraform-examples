List of Existing Assets
------------------------

-  **xc:** F5 Distributed Cloud WAF
-  **infra:** GCP Infrastructure
-  **App:** Juiceshop demo application



Tools
------

-  **Cloud Provider:** GCP
-  **IAC:** Terraform
-  **IAC State:** Terraform Cloud
-  **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

Terraform Cloud
----------------

-  **Workspaces:** Create CLI or API workspaces for each asset in the
   workflow. ``NOTE: Please use unique workspaces for each work-flow and don't club them with other use cases as you may run into conflicting cloud resource and provider errors.``

   +---------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
   |         **Workflow**      |  **Assets/Workspaces**                    |
   +===========================+===========================================+
   | deploy-waf-gcp            | gcp-infra, juiceshop, xc                  |
   +---------------------------+-------------------------------------------+


-  **Workspace Sharing:** Under the settings for each Workspace, set the
   **Remote state sharing** to share with each Workspace created.

-  **Variable Set:** Create a Variable Set with the following values and them as sensitive:

   +------------------------------------------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
   |         **Name**                         |  **Type**    |      **Description**                                 |
   +==========================================+==============+======================================================+
   | GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS                       | Environment  | Google credentials file content of Service Account   |
   +------------------------------------------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
   | VES_P12_PASSWORD                         | Environment  | Password set while creating F5XC API certificate     |
   +------------------------------------------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
   | VOLT_API_P12_FILE                        | Environment  | Your F5XC API certificate. Set this to **api.p12**   |
   +------------------------------------------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
   | ssh_key                                  | TERRAFORM    | Your ssh key for accessing the created resources     |
   +------------------------------------------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
   | tf_cloud_organization                    | TERRAFORM    | Your Terraform Cloud Organization name               |
   +------------------------------------------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+



GitHub
-------

-  Fork and Clone Repo. Navigate to ``Actions`` tab and enable it.

-  **Actions Secrets:** Create the following GitHub Actions secrets in
   your forked repo

   -  P12: The linux base64 encoded F5XC P12 certificate. NOTE: you can run `base64 <file-name>` to get this output
   -  TF_API_TOKEN: Your Terraform Cloud API token
   -  TF_CLOUD_ORGANIZATION: Your Terraform Cloud Organization name
   -  GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS: Your GCP credentials file content
   -  SSH_KEY: Your ssh key file without spaces
   -  TF_CLOUD_WORKSPACE\_\ *<Workspace Name>*: Create for each
      workspace in your workflow per each job

      -  TF_CLOUD_WORKSPACE_INFRA would be created with the
         value ``gcp-infra``

      -  TF_CLOUD_WORKSPACE_APP would be created with the
         value ``juiceshop``

      -  TF_CLOUD_WORKSPACE_XC would be created with the
         value ``xc``


Workflow Runs
--------------

**STEP 1:** Check out a branch with the branch name as suggested below for the workflow you wish to run using
the following naming convention.

**DEPLOY**

================================               =======================
Workflow                                       Branch Name
================================               =======================
Deploy F5 XC WAF on GCP CE                     deploy-waf-gcp
================================               =======================

Workflow File: `gcp-waf-ce-apply.yaml </.github/workflows/gcp-waf-ce-apply.yaml>`__

**DESTROY**

================================               =======================
Workflow                                       Branch Name
================================               =======================
Destroy F5 XC WAF on GCP CE                    destroy-waf-gcp
================================               =======================

Workflow File: `gcp-waf-ce-destroy.yml </.github/workflows/gcp-waf-ce-destroy.yaml>`__

**STEP 2:** Rename ``gcp/infra/terraform.tfvars.examples`` to ``gcp/infra/terraform.tfvars`` and add the following data:

-  project_prefix = “Your project identifier name in **lower case** letters only - this will be applied as a prefix to all assets”

-  gcp_region = “GCP Region/Location” ex. "asia-south1"

-  gcp_project_id = “User GCP project ID"

-  Also update assets boolean value as shown below

.. image:: assets/infra-tfvars.JPG

**Step 3:** Rename ``xc/terraform.tfvars.examples`` to ``xc/terraform.tfvars`` and add the following data:

-  api_url = “Your F5XC tenant”

-  xc_tenant = “Your tenant id available in F5 XC ``Administration`` section ``Tenant Overview`` menu”

-  xc_namespace = “The existing XC namespace where you want to deploy resources”

-  app_domain = “the FQDN of your app (cert will be autogenerated)”

-  xc_waf_blocking = “Set to true to enable blocking”

-  k8s_pool = "false"

-  advertise_sites = "set to true"

-  http_only = "set to true"

-  gcp_ce_site = "set to true since we want to deploy GCP CE site"

-  gcp = "gcp-infra"

.. image:: assets/xc-tfvars.JPG


**STEP 4:** Commit and push your build branch to your forked repo

- Build will run and can be monitored in the GitHub Actions tab and TF Cloud console. ``If CICD failed because of intermittent timing issue, rerun the work-flow again.``

**STEP 5:** Once the pipeline completes, verify your CE, Origin Pool and LB were deployed. (**Note:** CE sites will take 15-20 mins to come online)

.. image:: assets/gcp-site.JPG


**STEP 6:** Once CE site is online and to validate the test infra & demo app accessibility, copy the public IP of CE site in `GCP CE Site View mode` and send a request with XC LB domain as a `Host` header, You should be able to access the demo application as shown in the image below:

.. image:: assets/gcp-ce-ip.jpg
   
.. image:: assets/postman.jpg


**STEP 7:** If you want to destroy the entire setup, checkout a branch with name ``destroy-waf-gcp`` (using current deploy-waf-gcp branch) which will trigger destroy workflow and will remove all created resources
