Overview
#########
This guide provides detailed manual configuration steps for WAF (on RE )+ AppConnect scenarios along with the terraform scripts to automate the deployment. This helps users in configuring CE (Customer Edge) sites, connect the application which is not accessible from the internet and access it securely using F5 Distributed Cloud. For more details on WAF series, please refer to  `Deploy WAF Anywhere Overview Article <https://community.f5.com/t5/technical-articles/deploy-waap-anywhere-with-f5-distributed-cloud/ta-p/313079>`_

Below two scenarios of deploying application in different resources are covered in thie guide.

1. Deploy application in Virtual Machine.

2. Deploy application in Kubernetes Cluster.

**Note**: Automation scripts and steps will be attached soon. Even though the scenario here focuses on XC WAF, customers can enable any security services in the same setup, such as API Security, Bot Defense, DoS/DDOS and Fraud, as per their needs.
