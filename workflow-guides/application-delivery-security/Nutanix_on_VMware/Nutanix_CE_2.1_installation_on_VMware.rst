**Step 3: Installing Nutanix CE on VMware**
    **Step 3.1: Installing CE on VMware**
    Below are the steps gives detailed steps to configure single node cluster on VMware ESXi. 
    
    Before proceeding for the installation, make sure you have a list of IP-Addresses available on your own LAN, 

    * 2 IP addresses for AHV and CVM
    * 1 IP address for cluster 
    * Gateway and Netmask address details 

    These IP addresses should be on the same network as where your machine is available in. We are going to use the bridge network functionality from VMware ESXi so that AHV, CVM and cluster IP are available on your network.

    I have configured my setup details as below,

    * 10.144.126.61, 10.144.125.62 for AHV and CVM 
    * 10.144.126.63 for Cluster IP 
    * 10.144.126.254 and 255.255.255.0 as Gateway and Netmask 

    Installer screen logs shown as below, 

    .. figure:: Assets/ce-install.jpg
    
    When the boot sequence finishes, the CE installer dialog appears,

    .. figure:: Assets/ce-install-dialog.jpg

    In the screenshot mentioned above, Hypervisor selection is AHV, and Hard disks were selected for CVM boot disk and others as Data disk. Use Tab to navigate to the Disk Selection field.  
    
    Use the up arrow and down arrow keys to navigate between the disk selection, use **C** to confirm the CVM boot disk, **H** to confirm the hypervisor boot disk selection, Similarly **D** for Data Disk. 
    
    Provide the networking information such as Host IP address, CVM IP Address, Subnet Mask and Gateway that you gathered. 
    
    Press Tab to select Next Page and press Enter. 

    Read the end-user license agreement (EULA). Use the up arrow and down arrow keys to scroll. Press Tab to navigate to the **I accept the end user license agreement** checkbox.

    .. figure:: Assets/eula-license-aggrement.jpg

    Press the spacebar to select the checkbox. Use the arrow keys to navigate to Start and press Enter to start the installation process. 

    Installation process as follows, 

    .. figure:: Assets/ce-install-process-1.jpg

    .. figure:: Assets/ce-install-process-2.jpg

    .. figure:: Assets/ce-install-process-3.jpg
    
    Before proceeding to the bootup, need to initiate the boot sequence from AHV virtual disk, to get it done, we are going to disable the CD/DVD drive 1 from which initial boot sequence was initiated. 

    * Disabled Connect at power on checkbox. 
    
    .. figure:: Assets/ce-install-disable-power-on.jpg
    
    * A pop up shows, ejecting the CD-ROM to initiate the bootup process, 

    * Click on Yes and click on Answer. 

    .. figure:: Assets/ce-install-dialog-answer.jpg

    * Enter the Y key and press Enter. 

    .. figure:: Assets/ce-install-enable-y.jpg
    
    Now the VM will be booted with AHV. 

    .. figure:: Assets/nutanix_ce_install.jpg

    **Step 3.2: Creating and configuring single node cluster**

    Once you are at the AHV, you can see the login prompt, you can login with default credentials with username as **root** and password as **nutanix/4u** 

    It takes sometimes to come up for creating of cluster. 

    .. figure:: Assets/cluster-creation-login.jpg

    Now, ssh to CVM with the CVM IP address (you can also use CVM internal IP 192.168.5.2) with username: **nutanix** and password as **nutanix/4u**

    .. figure:: Assets/cluster-creation-process-1.jpg
    
    * Execute “watch -d genesis status” command to check if genesis is running. 
    
    .. figure:: Assets/cluster-creation-genesis-status.jpg

    This confirms genesis is running (there are pids behind the service name). Press CTRL + C to quit watch. 

    Now, we are good to execute command for single node creation, 

        * For a single node cluster, the command is: **cluster -s <cvm_ip> --redundancy_factor=1 –-cluster_external_ip=<cluster_ip> create**

    It may take a while as the cluster is created, and all services are started on the CVM.

    .. figure:: Assets/cluster-creation-cluster-cmd.jpg

    .. figure:: Assets/cluster-creation-cluster-success.jpg

    This confirms cluster is successfully created as shown in above screenshot. 

        * Execute the ncli cluster cmd to add name server to the cluster: **ncli cluster add-to-name-servers servers=<name_server_ip>**

    .. figure:: Assets/cluster-creation-name-server.jpg

    Cluster is created successfully and ready to be accessed.

**Step 4: Accessing the Web Console**

We can be able to access the Nutanix console with https:// <External_IP> or <CVM_IP> with port number 9440 provided during cluster creation. 

.. figure:: Assets/cluster-access.jpg

Sign in with default admin account username and password. 
    * Username: admin 
    * Password: nutanix/4u 

When prompted, change the default password. 

Signin with the admin account username and the new password. 

After login with the new password, you will see the page details as below, 

.. figure:: Assets/cluster-access-next-credentials.jpg

You need to login with your Nutanix Community account.  

Click **Create account** if you have not joined the Next Community. Community Edition check to ensure that the Community Edition role associated with your account is enabled. To enable the community Edition role, register at `Nutanix Website <https://www.nutanix.com/products/register>`__. 

If you have already registered to the Nutanix community, Click on **Activate** button on Community Edition tile and enter your registered email id for registration. 

Now, login to above prompt with Nutanix credentials and page takes you to Nutanix dashboard.
