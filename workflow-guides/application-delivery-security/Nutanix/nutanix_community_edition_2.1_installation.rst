.. figure:: Assets/Nutanix_Dell_PowerEdge_overview.jpeg

Above screenshot shows the Dell PowerEdge R430 HW that I brought up to install Nutanix CE. After connecting necessary USB drives such as Installer and Hypervisor boot and other HW, I have installed AHV Hypervisor followed by Controller Virtual Machine (CVM) for managing the storing and providing the management plane. Once everything is up and running, we login to CVM or cluster’s external IP address to create virtual machines.

Detailed process of Nutanix CE installation is below.

Procedure to Install Nutanix CE 2.1 on Bare Metal:
***************

Below are the series of steps to be followed to install CE on any Bare Metal server,

Make sure that you have a valid `Nutanix Community <https://next.nutanix.com/>`__ account, if not sign up to `Nutanix registration page <https://my.nutanix.com/page/signup>`__.  

1. Prepare installation media 

2. Install Nutanix Community Edition 

3. Create and configure a single-node cluster 

4. Access the Web Console 

**Step 1: Preparing installation media**

After registering to Nutanix account, go to the `Community Edition discussion forum <https://next.nutanix.com/discussion-forum-14>`__ and click the **Download Community Edition** topic.

**Note:** Nutanix recommends using drive with USB 3.0 or later to avoid networking and installation timeouts, but you can use virtual media to perform installation. Nutanix recommends a smaller capacity than all the other drivers (Data & CVM) on the node.

Under **Installer ISO**, click the download link. Image the installation device with the installer ISO file.

Download the latest edition of `Rufus <https://rufus.ie/en/>`__ here and open the application. Select the downloaded ISO image and rest of the configs were set to default, click on start button to image. Once the process is done, eject the USB drive and insert it to selected Bare Metal HW.

Before proceeding installing Nutanix CE, gather the following information that is required during installation process,

* Host IP address (for CE hypervisor host) 

* Controller VM (CVM) IP address 

* Subnet mask 

* Gateway 

* DNS, NTP, and proxy server IP addresses (if applicable)

**Step 2: Installing Nutanix CE 2.1**

Before you begin, ensure that your hardware meets the requirements mentioned above.

Insert both the USB drives to the Bare Metal server you have, one with Installer image and other for AHV boot disk.

As informed, Nutanix CE is installed on Dell PowerEdge R430 Bare Metal. Login to Dell iDRAC and click on **Power/Thermal** > **Power Configuration**. Select **Reset System (warm boot)** and click on **Apply** button to boot the bare metal.

.. figure:: Assets/idrac_boot_settings.jpg

Device starts to bootup and navigate to boot settings to initiate the boot from the USB drive imaged with CE.

.. figure:: Assets/idrac_bootup.png

Click on F11 bootup process to modify the boot sequence.

.. figure:: Assets/F11_boot_step.jpg

From the boot sequence, set the boot device to the imaged installation device.

.. figure:: Assets/rufus_boot_installer.jpg

Save the configuration changes and initiate the bootup. 

.. figure:: Assets/save_changes.png

Boot process starts by booting USB drive.

It will take a couple of minutes to get to installer screen.

.. figure:: Assets/ce_bootup_process_1.png

When the boot sequence finishes, the CE installer dialog appears.

.. figure:: Assets/ce_boot_layout_dialog.png

As you can be able to see, Hypervisor selection is AHV, and Hard disks were selected as one of the SSD for CVM boot disk and others as Data disk which is by default. Use Tab to navigate to the Disk Selection field. One of the USB is selected as Installer and other as Hypervisor boot disk.

Use the up arrow and down arrow keys to navigate between the disk selection, use **C** to confirm the CVM boot disk, **H** to confirm the hypervisor boot disk selection, Similarly **D** and **I** for Data Disk, Installer.

Provide the networking information such as Host IP address, CVM IP Address, Subnet Mask and Gateway that you gathered.  

I have provided details as **10.146.20.100, 10.146.20.101, 255.255.255.0, 10.146.20.254** respectively. 

Press Tab to select Next Page and press Enter.

Read the end-user license agreement (EULA). Use the up arrow and down arrow keys to scroll. Press Tab to navigate to the **I accept the end user license agreement** checkbox.

Press the spacebar to select the checkbox. Use the arrow keys to navigate to Start and press Enter to start the installation process. 

Nutanix is a Hyperconverged Platform, it is not only installing AHV Hypervisor but also management plane and storage controller as well. Installation process as follows,

.. figure:: Assets/ce_installation_process_2.png

.. figure:: Assets/ce_installation_process_3.png

A prompt appears to remove CE installation media, Remove the CE installation media depending on your Bare Metal HW (to make sure device does not boot again with installer image). Enter the **Y** key and press Enter. 

.. figure:: Assets/ce_installation_process_4.png

Since my Bare Metal setup consists of 2 USB drives, once the bootup process started, I need to change the boot sequence from boot manager, so that device boots with AHV hypervisor installed.

.. figure:: Assets/AHV_bootsequence_change.jpg

.. figure:: Assets/save_changes.png

.. figure:: Assets/reboot_idrac.png

Now the device will be booted with AHV.

.. figure:: Assets/nutanix_ahv_logs.jpg

**Step 3: Creating and configuring a cluster**

Once you are at the AHV, you can see the login prompt, you can login with default credentials with username as **root** and password as **nutanix/4u** 

It takes sometimes to come up for creating of cluster.

.. figure:: Assets/AHV_login.png

Now, ssh to CVM with the CVM IP address (you can also use CVM internal IP 192.168.5.2) with username: **nutanix** and password as **nutanix/4u**

Once **cluster status** command shows cluster is unconfigured, now you can go ahead and create a cluster.

.. figure:: Assets/ahv_cluster_creation.png

Since we are creating a single-node cluster, execute the command **cluster –s <cvm_ip> –-redundancy_factor=1 create**

.. figure:: Assets/cluster_creation.jpg

.. figure:: Assets/cluster_creation_3.png

It takes a few minutes to create the cluster and shows success message that cluster is successfully created.

.. figure:: Assets/cluster_success.jpg

Now, let us configure cluster parameters such as cluster name, external IP address, NTP server etc.

External IP address is with which we access the Nutanix Web console,

Cli to configure an external IP address for the cluster is **ncli cluster set-external-ip-address external-ip-address=<cluster_ip_address>**

I have provided cluster IP as **10.146.20.102**

Now, setup is good and ready to be accessed.

**Step 4: Accessing the web console**

In a web browser, navigate to http:// <External_IP> or <CVM_IP> with port number 9440 to access the Nutanix console.

.. figure:: Assets/nutanix_web_console.png

Sign in with default admin account username and password. 

* Username: admin 
* Password: nutanix/4u 

When prompted, change the default password.

Sign in with the admin account username and the new password.

Finally, we need to connect our next community account to the cluster by providing the Nutanix Community credentials. If you can’t sign in using your Nutanix community credentials, your account might not be registered to use CE. Complete the `CE registration <https://www.nutanix.com/products/community-edition/register>`__ page to register your account.

.. figure:: Assets/nutanix_account.jpg

Once the login is successfully, you will see the Nutanix dashboard details as shown below,

.. figure:: Assets/nutanix_dashboard.png

This confirms Nutanix CE 2.1 is successfully installed on Bare Metal. Virtual Instances can now be created.

**Conslusion:**
