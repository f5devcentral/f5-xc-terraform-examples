F5 Distributed Cloud Application Delivery and Security for Scalable Enterprise Workload Deployments across Heterogeneous Environments
#########################################################
Scope
--------------
As enterprises modernize and expand their digital services, they increasingly deploy multiple instances of the same applications across diverse infrastructure environments—such as VMware, OpenShift, Nutanix, and public clouds—to support distributed teams, regional data sovereignty, redundancy, or environment-specific compliance needs. These application instances often integrate into service chains that span across clouds and data centers, introducing both scale and operational complexity.

F5 Distributed Cloud provides a unified solution for secure, consistent application delivery and security across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. It enables organizations to add workloads seamlessly—whether for scaling, redundancy, or localization—without sacrificing visibility, security, or performance.

Introduction
--------------
This article examines enterprise-scale application deployment patterns that result in multiple instances of the same workloads across heterogeneous environments. Common enterprise scenarios include:

- Running identical customer-facing services in VMware-based private data centers and OpenShift-based development or staging clusters.

- Deploying business-critical applications across Nutanix on-prem infrastructure for edge locations and public clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP) for global reach.

- Supporting multi-region high availability by duplicating services across on-premises VMware clusters and cloud-native Kubernetes platforms.

F5 Distributed Cloud helps organizations manage these deployments by ensuring uniform application delivery and security policies across all instances—regardless of the underlying platform.

As illustrated in the diagram, when new application workloads are provisioned across environments such as AWS, Azure, GCP, VMware (on-prem), Nutanix (on-prem), and OpenShift Container Platform (on-prem), F5 Distributed Cloud ensures seamless integration with existing services. Using Secure Mesh Site v2 (SMSv2) with Customer Edge (CE) nodes, each location maintains secure, low-latency connectivity with F5’s globally distributed Regional Edges (RE) to support real-time traffic management, security enforcement, and observability.

Distributed Cloud CE is managed centrally using the Distributed Cloud Console. Distributed Cloud CE can be deployed as a standalone virtual machine (VM) or as a Kubernetes containerized service in any environment. It orchestrates the local control plane and data plane components to route, encrypt, and secure traffic. Distributed Cloud CE operates as a highly available edge gateway that can securely extend application connectivity and networks across sites, without the need to establish additional physical connectivity.

Architecture Overview

**VMware:** VM is created in VMware ESXi deployed in Dell PowerEdge-R640 bare metal. The VM is booted using the OVF image of SMSv2 CE downloaded from F5 Distributed Cloud. Once the CE VM is up and site is online, VM running application workloads is also deployed in the same ESXi and connected to CE using Site Local Inside (SLI) subnet and interface, so that applications are not exposed directly.

*Note: This scenario uses VMware On-Prem, but it can also be deployed on GCP and Azure.*

**Nutanix on Bare Metal:** Nutanix Community Edition is used as Hypervisor and deployed in Dell PowerEdge-R430 bare metal. A VM is created and booted using the qcow2 image of SMSv2 CE downloaded from F5 Distributed Cloud. Once the CE VM is up and site is online, VM running application workloads are also deployed and connected to CE using Site Local Inside (SLI) subnet and interface, so that applications are not exposed directly.

*Note: This scenario uses Nutanix On-Prem, but it can also be deployed on AWS and Azure.*

Nutanix Infra Setup

**OpenShift Container Platform (OCP):** 3-node OCP cluster is created on VMware. SMSv2 CE as VM is deployed using KVM (qcow) image in OCP cluster virtualization. VM running application workloads is also deployed and connected to CE using Site Local Inside (SLI) subnet and interface, so that applications are not exposed directly.

*Note: This scenario uses OCP Datacenter (On-Prem), but it can also be deployed on AWS, GCP, IBM and Azure.*
