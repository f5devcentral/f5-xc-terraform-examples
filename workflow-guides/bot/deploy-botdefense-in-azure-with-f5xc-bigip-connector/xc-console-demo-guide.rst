Deploy Bot Defense for Azure with F5 XC BIG-IP Connector
========================================================

Objective :
-----------

This guide will outline the steps for implementing F5 XC Bot Defense to protect your Azure Kubernetes workloads using our BIG-IP Connector. First we will be deploying our sample application into Azure AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service). Then we will deploy into Azure and front-end this application with F5's BIG-IP virtual appliance configured with our XC Bot Defense Connector. We'll leverage F5 XC to setup and download our Bot Defense Connector which will be deployed directly to the BIG-IP virtual appliance. This guide will outline the steps for implementing this infrastructure via Console Steps as well as Automated method using Terraform.

Manual step by step process for deployment:
-------------------------------------------

Console Deployment Prerequisites:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. F5 Distributed Cloud Account (F5XC)
2. Azure Cloud Account (If you don't have an Azure subscription, create an Azure free account before you begin `here <https://portal.azure.com/>`_) 
3. Azure CLI: Install the Azure CLI on your local machine. You can download it from the official Azure `CLI website <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli>`_
4. kubectl: Install kubectl on your local machine. You can find installation instructions on the `kubectl installation page <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/>`_



Steps:
^^^^^^


Signing into Azure CLI
======================

1. From CLI run the "az login" command
2. If the Azure CLI can open your default browser, it initiates authorization code flow and opens the default browser to load an Azure sign-in page
3. Sign in with your account credentials in the browser
4. If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, select the appropriate subscription ID in which the resources should be billed using the az account set command

Create Azure Resource Group and Networks
=========================================

1. Create resource group from CLI using the "az group create --name az-xcbotdefense-rg1 --location westus2" command
2. Create our vnet and subnet resources in that group using the following command "az network vnet create --resource-group az-xcbotdefense-rg1 --name az-xcbotdefense-vnet1  --address-prefixes 10.248.0.0/16 --subnet-name az-xcbotdefense-subnet1 --subnet-prefix 10.248.1.0/24"

.. image:: assets/rg-create2.png
   :width: 100%


Create the AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) Cluster
=================================================

1. To create an AKS cluster, we'll use the az aks create command. The following example creates a cluster named "az-xcbotdefense-cluster1" with one node and enables a system-assigned managed identity
2. Copy paste the command "az aks create --resource-group az-xcbotdefense-rg1 --name az-xcbotdefense-cluster1 --enable-managed-identity --node-count 1 --generate-ssh-keys" 
3. After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster

.. image:: assets/az-aks-create-2.png
   :width: 100%


Connect to the Cluster:
==========================

1. Configure kubectl to connect to your Kubernetes cluster using the az aks get-credentials command. This command downloads credentials and configures the Kubernetes CLI to use them.
2. Copy paste the following command into cli "az aks get-credentials --resource-group az-xcbotdefense-rg1 --name az-xcbotdefense-cluster1"
3. Verify the connection to your cluster using the "kubectl get nodes" command. This command returns a list of the cluster nodes.
4. The following sample output shows the single node created in the previous steps. Make sure the node status is Ready.

.. image:: assets/kubectl-getnodes3.png
   :width: 100%


Deploy our Sample Airline Application to the AKS Cluster:
=========================================================

1. Create a namespace using "kubectl create namespace az-xcbotdefense-namespace1"
2. Download the Kubernetes .yaml file for AKS using our sample Airline application `here <https://github.com/karlbort/f5-xc-waap-terraform-examples/blob/main/workflow-guides/bot/deploy-botdefense-in-azure-with-f5xc-bigip-connector/airline-app/az-xcbotdefense-app.yaml>`_ and save it to a working directory
3. From CLI Navigate to the directory containing the container image YAML file and run the command "kubectl apply -f az-xcbotdefense-app.yaml -n az-xcbotdefense-namespace1".
4. Check the status of the deployed pods using the "kubectl get pods -n az-xcbotdefense-namespace1" command. Make sure all pods are Running before proceeding.
5. Once this command has finished executing you can find the ingress IP by running the command "kubectl get services -n az-xcbotdefense-namespace1". Copy the external dns name as we'll be using this as the backend of our BIG-IP Virtual Server.

Create VNET Peering:
====================

1. Navigate to the Azure Portal and in the upper left hamburger menu click on "Resource Groups". Then create a Filter of "az-xcbotdefense-rg1" so that we can see the resource group we created manually as well as the resource group automatically created by the aks cluster deployment.

.. image:: assets/az-rg1-2.png
   :width: 75%

2. Let's start with our configuration in the "MC_az-xcbotdefense-rg1_az-xcbotdefense-cluster2_westus2" cluster created resource group. Within the resource group navigate to the aks-vnet-123xxx > settings > peerings > add 

.. image:: assets/aks-peering2.png
   :width: 75%

3. Starting with "This Virtual Network" and enter the Peering link name of "aks-vnet-to-az-xcbotdefense-vnet1" 
4. Check "allow aks-vnet-123xxx to access the peered virtual network"
5. Check "allow aks-vnet-123456 to receive forwarded traffic from the peered virtual network"
6. Under "Remote virtual network" enter the peering link name of "az-xcbotdefense-vnet1-to-aks-vnet" 
7. Make sure you have the correct subsription selected and then find the remote virtual network in the dropdown by typing "az-xcbotdefense-vnet1"
8. select "allows az-xcbotdefense-vnet1" to access aks-vnet and "allow az-xcbotdefense-vnet1 to receive forwarded traffic from aks-vnet"

.. image:: assets/vnet-peering.png
   :width: 75%

9. Click Add and refresh the peerings page until the peering status shows "connected"
10. Navigate to your other resource group az-xcbotdefense-rg1 > az-xcbotdefense-vnet1 > peerings > and confirm it shows peerings status "connected". If not, you will need to configure the same on this vnet side but in reverse.

Simulating Bot Traffic with CURL:
=================================

1. Within this repo you can download the `curl-stuff.sh <https://github.com/karlbort/f5-xc-waap-terraform-examples/blob/main/workflow-guides/bot/deploy-botdefense-in-azure-with-f5xc-bigip-connector/validation-tools/curl-stuff.sh>`_ Bash script in the validation-tools directory to run it against your web application to generate some generic Bot Traffic
2. After you've downloaded the curl-stuff.sh script you can edit the file using a text editor and replace the domain name on line 3 with the public IP Address of your BIG-IP. For example, curl -s http://x.x.x.x/user/signin NOTE*** ensure that you maintain the "/user/signin" path as this is the protected endpoint we configured in our profile.
3. Run the curl script with sh curl-stuff.sh. Note the failure response in the screenshot below
