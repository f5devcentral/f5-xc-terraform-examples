Deploy Bot Defense for GCP with F5 XC BIG-IP Connector
========================================================

Objective :
-----------

This guide will outline the steps for implementing F5 XC Bot Defense to protect your GKE Kubernetes workloads in GCP using our BIG-IP Connector. First we will be deploying our sample application into GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine). Then we will front-end this application with F5's BIG-IP virtual appliance in GCP configured with our XC Bot Defense Connector. We'll leverage F5 XC to setup and download our Bot Defense Connector which will be deployed directly to the BIG-IP virtual appliance. This guide will outline the steps for implementing this infrastructure via Console Steps as well as Automated method using Terraform.

Manual step by step process for deployment:
-------------------------------------------

Console Deployment Prerequisites:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. F5 Distributed Cloud Account (F5XC)
2. GCP Cloud Account (If you don't have an GCP subscription, create an GCP free account before you begin `here <https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial/signup/>`_)
3. Gcloud CLI: Install the Gcloud CLI on your local machine using option b) from `Gcloud CLI website <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install>`_
4. kubectl: Install kubectl on your local machine. You can find installation instructions on the `kubectl installation page <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/>`_



Steps:
^^^^^^


Signing into Gcloud CLI
=======================

1. Ensure you've followed the deployment prerequisites to install Gcloud CLI from `Gcloud CLI website <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install>`_ using option b)
2. After installation, initialize Gcloud CLI with the "gcloud init" command. Choose your user account, project, and set the default compute/region to us-west1. `Initializing Gcloud Documentation <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing>`_

Create the GCP VPC and Subnets
===============================

1. Copy/Paste into Gcloud CLI > "gcloud compute networks create gcp-xcbotdefense-vpc1 --subnet-mode=custom"
2. Copy/Paste into Gcloud CLI > "gcloud compute networks subnets create gcp-xcbotdefense-subnet1  --network=gcp-xcbotdefense-vpc1 --region=us-west1 --range=10.252.1.0/24"


Create the GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) Cluster
=================================================

1. Create the cluster and deploy into the vpc and subnet we created. Use the following command to create a cluster named gcp-xcbotdefense-cluster1 "gcloud container clusters create gcp-xcbotdefense-cluster1 --network=gcp-xcbotdefense-vpc1 --subnetwork=gcp-xcbotdefense-subnet1"
2. Once the cluster has been created, use the following command to get the credentials to communicate with the cluster "gcloud container clusters get-credentials gcp-xcbotdefense-cluster1 --location us-west1" 
3. Verify the connection to your cluster using the "kubectl get nodes" command. This command returns a list of the cluster nodes.

Deploy our Sample Airline Application to the GKE Cluster:
=========================================================

1. Create a namespace using "kubectl create namespace gcp-xcbotdefense-namespace1"
2. Download the Kubernetes .yaml file for GKE using our sample Airline application `here <https://github.com/karlbort/f5-xc-waap-terraform-examples/blob/main/workflow-guides/bot/deploy-botdefense-in-gcp-with-f5xc-bigip-connector/airline-app/gcp-xcbotdefense-app.yaml>`_ and save it to a working directory
3. From CLI Navigate to the directory containing the container image YAML file and run the command "kubectl apply -f gcp-xcbotdefense-app.yaml -n gcp-xcbotdefense-namespace1".
4. Check the status of the deployed pods using the "kubectl get pods -n gcp-xcbotdefense-namespace1" command. Make sure all pods are Running before proceeding.
5. Once this command has finished executing you can find the ingress IP by running the command "kubectl get services -n gcp-xcbotdefense-namespace1". Note that the external IP is in the gcp-xcbotdefense-subnet1 (10.252.1.0/24) that we created. Make a note of this address as we'll be using this as the backend of our BIG-IP Virtual Server.

Connect to BIG-IP:
==================

1. The first time you boot BIG-IP VE, you must connect to the instance and create a strong admin password. You will use the admin account and password to access the BIG-IP Configuration utility
2. In the Google Console, under VM Instances > gcp-xcbotdefense-bigip1-vm, details > SSH > View Gcloud Command > Copy to Clipboard > Paste into local Gcloud CLI. Type admin@ before the instance name, for example: gcloud compute ssh --zone "us-west1-a" "admin@gcp-xcbotdefense-bigip1-vm" --project "myprojectname"
3. Occassionally, SSH will ask for a passphrase even when one hasn't been created, if SSH key is password protected "cd ~/.ssh", "sudo ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine -C username@myemail.com"
4. Once you have access to the BIG-IP CLI, to ensure you are at the tmsh command prompt, type tmsh
5. Change the admin password with the command "modify auth password admin" and press enter, type the password and then confirm. 
6. Ensure that the system retains the password change with the command "save sys config"
7. Open a web browser and log in to the BIG-IP Configuration utility by using https with the external IP address and port 8443, for example: https://<external-ip-address>:8443. The username is admin and the password is the one you set previously. You can find the external ip address with "gcloud compute instances describe --zone=us-west1-a gcp-xcbotdefense-bigip1-vm --format='get(networkInterfaces[0].accessConfigs[0].natIP)' or with "gcloud compute instances list" and find gcp-xcbotdefense-bigip1-vm.

Create BIG-IP Service Pool :
============================

1. NOTE** You will need the external IP Address of your cluster from "kubectl get services -n gcp-xcbotdefense-namespace1". It should be a 10.252.1.x/24 IP address
2. Open a web browser and log in to the BIG-IP Configuration utility by using https with the external IP address and port 8443, for example: https://<external-ip-address>:8443. The username is admin and the password is the one you set previously. You can find the external ip address with "gcloud compute instances describe --zone=us-west1-a gcp-xcbotdefense-bigip1-vm --format='get(networkInterfaces[0].accessConfigs[0].natIP)' or with "gcloud compute instances list" and find gcp-xcbotdefense-bigip1-vm
3. Under the Main tab go to local traffic > pools > create 
4. Name "gcp-xcbotdefense-app1", Health Monitors "tcp"
5. Leave the default load balancing method at "Round Robin", add the node name of "gcp-xcbotdefense-app1", in the address field, paste the external ip from previous steps "10.252.1.x", set service port to "80 HTTP", Add, finished
6. If you refresh your page the status should turn green indicating successful health monitor to the aks app.

Simulating Bot Traffic with CURL:
=================================

1. Within this repo you can download the `curl-stuff.sh <https://github.com/karlbort/f5-xc-waap-terraform-examples/blob/main/workflow-guides/bot/deploy-botdefense-in-gcp-with-f5xc-bigip-connector/validation-tools/curl-stuff.sh>`_ Bash script in the validation-tools directory to run it against your web application to generate some generic Bot Traffic
2. After you've downloaded the curl-stuff.sh script you can edit the file using a text editor and replace the domain name on line 3 with the public IP Address of your BIG-IP. For example, curl -s http://x.x.x.x/user/signin NOTE*** ensure that you maintain the "/user/signin" path as this is the protected endpoint we configured in our profile.
3. Run the curl script with sh curl-stuff.sh. Note the failure response in the screenshot below
