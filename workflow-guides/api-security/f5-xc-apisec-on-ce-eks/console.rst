**Deploy F5XC API Security on Customer Edge in AWS EKS Console Guide**
==================================================================

Prerequisites:
--------------

1. AWS (Amazon Web Services) account with CLI credentials
2. eksctl, kubectl and awscli tools already configured in a linux
   instance
3. .yml files needed for deployment (these files are available in
   workflow-guides/waf/f5-xc-apisec-on-ce-k8s/assets folder)
4. Access to F5 XC account

EKS and CE Steps:
-----------------

**STEP 1:**  If k8s cluster (EKS) is not already available, then from Linux
    terminal, check below command to deploy EKS. If needed update it as
    per you requirements.
    ``eksctl create cluster --name ce-eks-new --version 1.21 --region us-west-1 --nodegroup-name standard-workers --node-type t3.xlarge --nodes 1 --managed --kubeconfig admin.conf``

**STEP 2:**  Once above command is successful, run below command to obtain
    kubeconfig. If you want to use existing EKS, then update name and
    region in below command.
    ``aws eks update-kubeconfig --name ce-eks-new --region us-west-1``

**STEP 3:**  Login to your F5 XC console and navigate to “Multi-Cloud Network
    Connect”, next to “Manage” tab “Site Management” menu and then to
    “Site Tokens” drop-down. Create a new site token and copy the UID.

**STEP 4:**  Login to your F5 XC console and navigate to Cloud and Edge sites.
    Create a new site token and copy the UID.

**STEP 5:**  Open the ce_k8s.yml file below and update Latitude, Longitude, token
    ID & other fields (from lines 143-158) as per your infrastructure.

**STEP 6:**  Download ce_k8s.yml file from `here <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/f5devcentral/f5-xc-terraform-examples/main/workflow-guides/waf/f5-xc-waf-on-k8s/assets/ce_k8s.yml>` and run this command to deploy the CE site -
    ``kubectl apply -f ce_k8s.yml``

**STEP 7:**  In F5 XC console navigate to Site management –> then to
    Registrations tab and approve the pending record

**STEP 8:**  Wait for 10-15 mins and check all XC related pods are running in
    ves-system namespace. Also check if this new CE site comes up as
    online in F5 XC console sites list

**STEP 9:**  From terminal, run below command to deploy bookinfo demo app -
    ``kubectl apply -l version!=v2,version!=v3 -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/release-1.16/samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml``

**STEP 10:** Download ce-k8s-lb.yml file from `here <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/f5devcentral/f5-xc-terraform-examples/main/workflow-guides/waf/f5-xc-waf-on-k8s/assets/ce_k8s-lb.yml>` and run this command to
    create the k8s load balancer - ``kubectl apply -f ce-k8s-lb.yml``

XC HTTP Load Balancer
---------------------

**STEP 1:** Log in to the F5 Distributed Cloud Console and naviate to
``Web App & API Protection``.

.. image:: assets/00-console.pnga. Select k8s service name and provide value as “productpage.default”
