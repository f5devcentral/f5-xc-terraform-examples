**Deploy F5XC API Security on Customer Edge in AWS EKS Console Guide**
==================================================================

Prerequisites:
--------------

1. AWS (Amazon Web Services) account with CLI credentials
2. eksctl, kubectl and awscli tools already configured in a linux instance
3. .yml files needed for deployment (these files are available in workflow-guides/waf/f5-xc-apisec-on-ce-k8s/assets folder)
4. Access to F5 XC account

EKS and CE Steps:
-----------------

**STEP 1:**  Set aws credentials as environment variables. If k8s cluster (EKS) is not already available, then from Linux terminal, check below command to deploy EKS. If needed update it as per you requirements.
    ``eksctl create cluster --name ce-eks-new --version 1.29 --region us-west-1 --nodegroup-name standard-workers --node-type t3.xlarge --nodes 1 --managed --kubeconfig admin.conf``

**STEP 2:**  Create an IAM OIDC identity provider ( for configuration steps click `here <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/enable-iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html>`__ ) and an IAM role with permission policy: "AmazonEBSCSIDriverPolicy" ( for configuration steps click `here <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/csi-iam-role.html>`__ follow this document till step 10).

**STEP 3:**  Add "Amazon EBS CSI driver" add-on to the created EKS cluster and attach the IAM role created in STEP 2 to this add-on.

**STEP 4:**  Once done, run below command to obtain kubeconfig. If you want to use existing EKS, then update name and region in below command.
    ``aws eks update-kubeconfig --name ce-eks-new --region us-west-1``

**STEP 5:**  Login to your F5 XC console and navigate to “Multi-Cloud Network Connect”, next to “Manage” tab “Site Management” menu and then to “Site Tokens” drop-down. Create a new site token and copy the UID.

**STEP 6:**  Download ce_k8s.yml file from `here <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/f5devcentral/f5-xc-terraform-examples/main/workflow-guides/waf/f5-xc-waf-on-k8s/assets/ce_k8s.yml>`__. Open the ce_k8s.yml file and update Latitude, Longitude, token ID & other fields (from lines 143-158) as per your infrastructure.

**STEP 7:**  Run this command to deploy the CE site - ``kubectl apply -f ce_k8s.yml``

**STEP 8:**  In F5 XC console navigate to Multi-Cloud Network Connect -> Manage -> Site management –> then to Registrations tab and approve the pending record

**STEP 9:**  Wait for 10-15 mins and check all XC related pods are running in "ves-system" namespace of EKS cluster. Also check if this new CE site comes up as online with health score as '100' in F5 XC console sites list. (Navigate to Multi-Cloud Network Connect -> Overview -> Sites)

**STEP 10:**  Clone the `repo <https://github.com/OWASP/crAPI>`__, run command: ``git clone https://github.com/OWASP/crAPI.git``

**STEP 11:**  Install the helm chart:
    ``cd deploy/helm
    helm install --namespace crapi crapi . --values values.yaml``

**STEP 12:**  If crapi namespace is not getting created, run ``kubectl create ns crapi`` and re-run command ``helm install --namespace crapi crapi . --values values.yaml``.
